Solving LeetCode problems in Rust

1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/): [`src/lc_001_two_sum.rs`](https://github.com/krshrimali/rust-leetcode/blob/main/src/lc_001_two_sum.rs)
2. [Count Good Meals](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-meals/): [`src/lc_002_count_good_meals.rs`](https://github.com/krshrimali/rust-leetcode/blob/main/src/lc_002_count_good_meals.rs)
